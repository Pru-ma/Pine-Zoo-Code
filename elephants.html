proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their incisors                        
tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help
controltheir body temperature. Their pillar -like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have concave backs
while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or levelbacks.</p>
